1. Our app handles light and dark themes really simply by implementing a if else boolean
within our NotesAppTheme composable. Above we selected the colors we would like to use
for the themes and below will check to see if our system settings have been set to dark mode
or not and apply the according colors. Within our NoteScreen.kt we call our composable when needed.

NOTE: Theme coloring is different from our Color.kt file which is our established default app
coloring scheme.
